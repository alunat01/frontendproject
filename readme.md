************************ Introduction ***********************

My website is for a charity called 'Save the Turtles' with an aim to raise awareness on protecting turtles and to allow users to donate, adopt or contact the charity through an online web system. 

Text Editor used: Brackets

My inspiration of the website came from: https://www.wwf.org.uk/

PROXIMITY: Grouping similar items together suggesting how to read content. 

I have achieved the above by grouping related elements together using <section> tags. 

It can also be seen on my website, where multiple grouped elements either have different coloured backgrounds or have large screen pictures seperating 




What to improve or future considerations: 
- Exploration of creative JavaScript such as hiding and showing elements
- Use of grid layout which would have been easier to group elements
- Improvements on position and alignments of contents. I struggled with aligning content to where I want it to.
